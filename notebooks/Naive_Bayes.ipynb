    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning</a> is a vast area of Computer Science that is concerned with designing algorithms which form good models of the world around us (the data coming from the world around us).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Machine Learning many tasks are - or can be reformulated as - classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks we are trying to produce a model which can give the correlation between the input data $X$ and the class $C$ each input belongs to. This model is formed with the feature-values of the input-data. For example, the dataset contains datapoints belonging to the classes *Apples*, *Pears* and *Oranges* and based on the features of the datapoints (weight, color, size etc) we are trying to predict the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need some amount of training data to train the Classifier, i.e. form a correct model of the data. We can then use the trained Classifier to classify new data. If the training dataset chosen correctly, the Classifier should predict the class probabilities of the new data with a similar accuracy (as it does for the training examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/classification.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "After construction, such a Classifier could for example tell us that document containing the words \"Bose-Einstein condensate\" should be categorized as a Physics article, while documents containing the words \"Arbitrage\" and \"Hedging\" should be categorized as a Finance article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Classifier (whose dataset is illustrated below) could tell whether or not a person makes <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult\" target=\"_blank\">more than 50K</a>, based on features such as Age, Education, Marital Status, Occupation etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/classification_dataset3.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, there is a input dataset $ X $ which corresponds to a 'output' $Y$. The dataset $X$ contains $m$ input examples  $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, .. , x^{(m)}$, and each input example has $n$ feature values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ (here $n\\ =\\ 7$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three popular Classifiers within Machine Learning, which use three different mathematical approaches to classify data; \n",
    "- **Naive Bayes**, which uses a statistical (Bayesian) approach, \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**, which uses a functional approach and \n",
    "- **Support Vector Machines**, which uses a geometrical approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we have already looked at <a href=\"http://ataspinar.com/2016/05/07/regression-logistic-regression-and-maximum-entropy-part-2-code-examples/\" target=\"_blank\">Logistic Regression</a>. Here we will see the theory behind the Naive Bayes Classifier together with its implementation in Python. \n",

    "<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a name=\"ch2\"></a>2. Naive Bayes Classification:</h1>\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are trying to classify data from a Statistical point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is that the probability (datapoint $x^{i}$ belongs to a) class $C\\ =\\ c_i$ is given by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability\">posterior probability</a> $P(C\\ |\\ x^{i})$. Here $x^{i}$ refers to an entry in the test set, consisting of n features; $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' rule, this posterior probability can be rewritten as:\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">$ P(C=c_i\\ |\\ x^{i}) = \\frac{P(x^{i}\\ |\\ C=c_j) \\cdot P(C=c_j)}{P(x^{i})} $</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since the marginal probability $P(x^{i})$ does not depends on the classes, it can be disregarded and the equation becomes:\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">$ P(C=c_j\\ |\\ x^{i}) = P(x^{i}\\ |\\ C=c_j) \\cdot P(C=c_j) $</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The training example $x^{(i)} $ belongs to the class $c_j$ which maximizes this probability, so:\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">$ C_{NB} = argmax\\ P(x^{(i)}|C=c_j) \\cdot P(C=c_j) $</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">$ C_{NB} = argmax\\ P(x_1, x_2, .., x_n | C=c_j) \\cdot P(C=c_j) $</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Assuming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence\">conditional independence</a> of the features $ x_k$, this equation simplifies to:\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">$ C_{NB} = argmax\\ P(x_1|C) \\cdot P(x_2|C) \\cdot \\cdot\\ \\cdot P(x_n|C) \\cdot P(C) $</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">$ C_{NB} = argmax\\ P(C) \\cdot \\prod_i P(x_i|C) $</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here $P(x_i | C)$ is the conditional probability that feature i belongs to class $C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This probability can simply be calculated by calculating the relative values of feature $i$ per class.\n",
    "This is should become more clear, if we look at our '50K income' example of above:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**First, we select all of the entries belonging to one class:**\n",
    "![title](img/classification_dataset3b.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "![title](img/classification_dataset3c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Then we calculate the relative frequency of the values of each feature:**\n",
    "![title](img/classification_dataset3d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So we need to make a Hash table, which contains all values of each feature, per class. These Hash tables can then be transformed into a Hash table containing the relative values of each feature. \n",
